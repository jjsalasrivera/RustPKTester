# Private Key Tester

Do you feel lucky? Try to find a abandoned wallet on Bitcoin blockchain. Keep in mind that there are 10^70 possible addresses; it's more likely to win the lottery than to try to find an abandoned wallet on the blockchain. But who knows?

This program was created with the purpose of learning how Bitcoin addressing works.

## Note

This program use a sqlite database with one table _"Addresses"_ with one collumn _"address"_ which contains all the addresses with a balance on the blockchain.

This database is brewed by hand using the csv downloaded from http://addresses.loyce.club/
